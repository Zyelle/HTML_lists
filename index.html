<h1>Hello and Welcome back to part 3 of whatever this is called!</h1>

    <body>
        <p> Alright, so this is my <strong>thrid</strong> time making an HTML. 
            I am simply documenting my work as I do The Odin Project. 
            This is my <strong>6th</strong> day, I believe, since I started on <strong>May 20, 2023</strong>. 
            I believe I have the date right. 
            I think I'll be doing <em>this</em> kind of stuff, such as documenting my journey. 
            I'll also make sure that every time I create a new one, I implement what I am learning throughout the curriculum.
        </p>
